machine. Also, because the machine the containers are running on is the same, the uptime that is printed, is the uptime of the system that the container is run on, which is same on both containers. This indicates that they use the hosting systems system time.
IP-addresses of the containers are in the default subnet which docker uses and this is of course shared with the host as it is in the private network of hosting machine.
Other things that are shared based on earlier findings is that containers share the Kernel and OS of the hosting machine. Also, we can see that processes are not the same with both containers and there is not listed all the processes in the hosting machine. This means that containers are running as isolated processes. Still, they are sharing the resources of the host machine and therefor are not running in fully isolated environment.
