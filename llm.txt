In this exercise I used ChatGPT 4o model to generate base for my docker files. Also, it helped to give me linux commands to fetch the system data from docker containers.
However, as always when using LLM, I first had to do research what I specifically want to do and then ask specific questions from LLM to get help with the task.
Also, Java dependencies caused some problems when running through docker, so I asked LLm for help debugging the issue and suggesting solutions to fix them.
This saved some time in the development process. I used LLm in a way I usually do in work and studying related stuff.
It is good tool to help getting forward and doing manual stuff, but bad creating large entities with long instructions.
For example LLM used some stupid patterns when asked to create Controller for making get-request to the Node-server.
I didn't want to start implementing SpringBoot even though LLm suggested to, as this was such a simple task. This is why I decided to write actual code myself.
Regarding docker compose. The Node Dockerfile was pretty much the same I would make from scratch myself. To Java version I used
slim version of jdk although due to that I had to add update and install for bash commands as lite version didn't seem to support them.
Maybe LLMs version would have been simpler after all but at least I get hands-on experience on using the slim JDK and maybe the start-up time is now a bit faster.
